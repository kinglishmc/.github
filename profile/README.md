### Our Mission 🎯
We believe English isn’t just for the US — it’s for *everyone*! 🌍 When it comes to **Minecraft mods**, why should they be limited to one version of English? Sadly, most mods are still stuck using US spelling and phrasing, leaving out players from all over the world.  

### What We Do 🔨
At Kinglish, we’re changing that! We translate Minecraft mods into a variety of English styles, from British 🇬🇧 to Australian 🇦🇺 and beyond. Our goal is to make sure every player feels at home in the world of Minecraft. 

### Why It Matters 💬
Minecraft should be for *everyone*, and that means having mods that speak your language, literally! We’re all about making the game more inclusive, relatable, and *fun* for players everywhere.

### Join Us ✨
We’re flipping the script, one translation at a time. Let’s make Minecraft even more *worldly* together!
